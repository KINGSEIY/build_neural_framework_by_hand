# build_neural_framework_by_hand


The core is the self_frame.py in the self_frame.py:
  we have Linera Sigmoid MSE_loss and topological_sort_from_disorder_to_order

otherwise,there is a simple test to use the frame_work:
  the emphasis is the test just a one dimention 
  

you can find the similar usage in the pytorch and tensorflow through this simple frame_work
